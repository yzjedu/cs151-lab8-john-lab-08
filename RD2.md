I liked this lab assignment. While I didn't really have a partner with me this time, doing the algoithm itself already
proved to be more than a challenge. My biggest problem when trying to write it is the displaying of the asterisks when
showing the results. Trying to make it format with the projected 1-13 outcome of sums seemed really hard to grasp at first,
but made more sense when I tried to understand it more and more.

Of course, I was using random functions again, which are always helpful for example scenarios like this. Learning Python
through activities like this has been wonderful and I'm very excited to continue doing this again and again. This project
also continued to emphasize to me the importance of algorithms and how much they are reflected upon in their eventual codings.
